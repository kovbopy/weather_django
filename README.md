NOTE: limited by 5 days/3 hours a step by api provider
NOTE: idk how exactly weather averages should be calculated,stats given by api provider are sometimes 
different from stats on normal sites, so the results in the app and one sites may be a bit different,
but the code works good

'now/<city>/  -- to see current weather
'hours/<period>/<city>/ -- hours/7-9/minsk/ (7-9 april) -- shows stats for every 3 hours  
'day/<period>/<city>/ -- day/9/minsk/ -- shows stats for the whole day
